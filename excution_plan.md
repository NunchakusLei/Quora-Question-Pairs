# Team work
Our team will host group meetings 2-3 times weekly, depends on the progress. At this moment we plan to meet after every MM 806 lectures.

We will use Skype and WeChat as communication tools to discuss the problems that we encountered and need to be solved. We will use Github to collaborating  coding.

# Expected Result
We are expecting we will be one of the top 1 group in class. Since all the algorithm and some of the code has already posted on the website, so it will be less research based, more practical based. Our job first is to understand the solution that is already shared online, then focus to reproduce the solution, and lastly adding new features to the model such that it will give a better result.
